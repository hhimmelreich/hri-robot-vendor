This is the repository for our group project 

"Robot vs. Human Vendor: Influence on Spending Behaviour in Human-Robot Interactions using Virtual Reality" 

for the course Human-Robot Interaction at the University of Osnabrueck in the WS 2021/22.

We planned, implemented and conducted a VR experiment to answer the following research question:

"Robot vs Human vendor - Who is more effective in increasing the spending behaviour of human customers?"

### Abstract of the report:

Robots already are a big part of our everyday life, however they are mostly used in industrial applications or monotonous labor while social tasks like shopping assistance or other interactions are still mostly handled by humans. Recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence make such use cases more feasible from a technical standpoint but the psychological background still needs more research.
In the following we introduce a virtual reality experiment in which we investigate whether robots can be effectively deployed as vendors.
Participants in a virtual market booth environment had the task of purchasing items from a shopping list while either a human or robot vendor was using typical selling strategies to increase the amount of money they spent. When directly comparing the performance between the robot and human vendors, no significant difference in the spending behaviour in the two conditions could be identified. 
As the sample size was very small, this study should be seen as a proof of concept and a basis for further work.
